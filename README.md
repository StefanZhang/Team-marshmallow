Official Documentation for WhereTo?

WhereTo is an iOS application that utilizes Apple's ARKit library and the PlaceNoteSDK. The parts of the application include the user mode and the Admin mode.

The Admin does the bulk of the work for the application while the user side is meant to follow the instructions that the Admin has layed out.

User Mode:
The file for the user can be found in the ______.swift file. What the user does is select a destination in the ViewControllerWT.swift then _______

Backend: 
Step 1: In ViewControllerWT.swift, after a user has selected a destination, the name of the map which contains this destination as well as the coordinate of the destination (type SCNVector3), will be passed to ViewControllerWAY.swift.

Step 2: In ViewControllerWAY.swift, after a user has selected a initial location, the name of the map which contains this initial location as well as the coordinate of the initial location (type SCNVector3), will be passed to ViewControllerUM.swift, together with the desitination information mentioned in Step 1.

Step 3: In ViewControllerUM.swift, there are two main functions: loadMapButton and showPathbutton. 
The loadMapButton function takes the information of maps in Step 2 and run A* algorithm to find the shortest path from getting from the initial location map to destination map. The A* algorithm was implemented in AppDelegate.swift and used the CoreLocation of all of the maps stored in the Placenote Cloud. The maps that form the shortest path will be saved in the global variable mapStack.
After a stack of the maps have been found, we need to generate a shortest path of breadcrumbs in each map. In each shortest path, the first breadcrumb is the one closest to the user's current location, and the last breadcrumb is either a checkpoint or the final destination. The showPathButton function generates this shortest path of breadcrumbs in every map. And A* algorithm was used just like before.

In summary, if the initial location and destination are in the same map, then we only need to generate the shortest path of breadcrumbs once and display the shapes. However, if they are in different maps, then a path of maps will be found, and in all but the last map, we generate the shortest path of breadcrumbs from the closest breadcrumb to the best checkpoint. The best checkpoint was selected based on the checkpoints and maps' CoreLocation.

Admin Mode:
The file for the admin can be found in the ViewController.swift file. What the admin does is ______

The login of admin need to be click on the side bar menu, and then click the admin login. The front end side bar menu implementation is taking care by the class MenuLauncherWT, MenuCellWT and BaseCell. MenuLauncherWT as a launcher class gets called once the button being clicked in ViewControllerWT, the reason we create a seperate class for this is to reduce the code in the ViewcontrollerWT, and indeed solve the "Fat ViewController" issue, and easier to debug in case something went wrong. In MenuLauncherWT, ShowMenu() display menu with specific coordinates and animation, HandleDismiss() handles the fade out animation. collectionView() handles menu selection, layout of the cells and number of cells in the menu bar. BaseCell class the parent cell of all cells, MenuCellWT is the customized Cell for Menu, inherite from BaseCell. MenuCellWT add label, icon and constraint to the menu cell.

Once the login button is clicked.........................

  Load Map-
  Once the load map button is pressed a table of all the maps that are the currently on placenote's cloud are displayed. To load a map, all of the metadata from placenote's cloud is downloaded. The shapes including: breadcrumbs, checkpoints, destinations are loaded based on their location to the world origin when the admin saves the map. 

  Destinations-
  The Admin has the ability to drop places known as destinations. After they press the button, line 1206 in ViewController.swift is    invoked. First what this does is goes to the ShapeManager.swift file and creates a subclass (Destination node) from the root class Navigaton Node. The shape type (pyramid), the size, the color and location when pressed can be configured here.

  Next, it opens an alert box for the admin to type in the destination name and type. After the information has been input, all of the  metadata regarding the destination including location and map it is inside of, is saved to the json that is sent to the Placenote cloud.
This all happens if there is no duplicate destination already in the storage. If there is a duplicate then the destination will not be able to be saved.
  
  Checkpoint-
  The Admin also has the ability to drop checkpoints. Checkpoints are a crucial part of the navigation process for the user. They are the main component for the MAP STITCHING component (more information can be found in user mode step 3). Once the admin presses the checkpoint button, line 1169 in ViewController.swift is invoked. This drops a checkpoint similar to how a destination is dropped except a few extra steps are taken. When a checkpoint is dropped its' core location is also stored in order to find out which checkpoint the user should navigate to in the MapStack.
